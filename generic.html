					<p style='text-indent: 30px;'>				I dreamt of this opportunity the night before. I felt nervous, even shaking. Not a minute passed since I
						last glanced at the clock. I paced around my room. Then ding, the alarm on my phone startled me out of deep
						thought. I pressed join and sat patiently waiting in front of my computer screen while the guests logged in.
						Soon, the supervisor began speaking. He gave a brief background about his path from being inside of
						classrooms to becoming founder of an educational organization. My anxiousness seemed to vanish until we were
						prompted to introduce ourselves. I opened my mouth, but all the air seemed to get stuck in my throat.
						Eventually, after calming myself down I spoke and everyone else did as well. Then, we received our first big
						project. My heart sank because I never had encountered a project such as this before. I felt comfortable
						with handheld physical projects, but virtual projects seemed out of my league. Overwhelmed with anxiety at
						the time, but I reassured myself that this was just another opportunity to learn. Right away I listened
						attentively to my supervisor ‘s instructions for as many instructions as I possibly could. Luckily, it was a
						group project, and I could collaborate with a peer. Our task involved creating an online course geared
						towards helping students in high school. First, I began by filling in my knowledge gaps. I went on YouTube
						and researched as much as I could about building an online course. I became familiar with WordPress and its
						wonderful features. I even found a front-end plug-in to bring an aesthetic design to the website page. I
						grew to love the website-building process and I knew it would pay off.
					</p>
					<p style='text-indent: 30px;'>				After I contacted my partner, we introduced ourselves and our goals as a team. Next, we started
						brainstorming the foundational content for the online course. We didn’t want our course to be just another
						disposable site with psychobabble. So, we decided to view it from a student’s perspective. We asked each
						other what we wished we would have known as high school students. We thought of different topics according
						to each grade level. For freshmen and sophomores, we prioritized time management and extracurricular
						participation. For juniors and seniors, we concurred with test taking skill assessment and resources for the
						college transition process.
					</p>
					<p style='text-indent: 30px;'>				With our course mapped out, we needed to implement our strategy. We divided the work among ourselves and
						completed different parts of the course. As I worked on organizing the website and its pages, I grew
						nervous. I became afraid to fail and potentially ruin the entire project. With careful progression, my fear
						subsided. During the entire project I learned by trial and error. For example, when I input data from the
						back end, the text either did not display correctly or appeared dull in the user interface. Therefore, I had
						to research and reattempt the same task until it came out perfectly.
					</p>
					<p style='text-indent: 30px;'>				Our deadline was approaching quickly, and my group had not finished. Concerned, I made a personal
						commitment to work overtime to complete our project. Sometimes, the website would take a long time to load
						and render objects. This was catastrophic. I had to constantly go back and forth between the front-end and
						back-end to ensure optimal viewer experience.
					</p>
					<p style='text-indent: 30px;'>				Finally, the course was completed a few days before the project deadline. My partner and I conducted
						quality assurance and fixed minor errors. My supervisor with our results. I believe that preparation and
						hard work helped me succeed. I felt accomplished after stepping out of my comfort zone. Less than three
						years later, I transitioned into the Honors College of Miami Dade College to major in computer science to
						ultimately pursue a career in website development.
